# Story 0.1: Firebase Project Configuration

**As a developer, I want to configure Firebase project with Firestore and Storage, so that I have a cloud backend for data persistence and file storage.**

## Overview
This story establishes the foundational Firebase cloud infrastructure that will replace the localStorage-based system with a real-time, collaborative platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1.1: Firebase project created with Firestore database enabled
- [ ] Create Firebase project in Firebase Console
- [ ] Enable Firestore database in test mode
- [ ] Configure database location (e.g., us-central1)
- [ ] Verify Firestore database is accessible and operational

### AC 1.2: Firebase Storage bucket configured for image uploads
- [ ] Enable Firebase Storage in Firebase project
- [ ] Create storage bucket for restaurant photos
- [ ] Configure storage bucket location to match Firestore region
- [ ] Verify storage bucket is accessible and ready for file uploads

### AC 1.3: Firebase Security Rules established for restaurants and reviews collections
- [ ] Create Firestore security rules for restaurants collection
- [ ] Create Firestore security rules for reviews collection
- [ ] Create Firebase Storage security rules for image uploads
- [ ] Rules allow read/write access with proper validation
- [ ] Rules prevent unauthorized data access and manipulation

### AC 1.4: Firebase project configuration file (firebase-config.js) created
- [ ] Generate Firebase project configuration from Firebase Console
- [ ] Create firebase-config.js file with project credentials
- [ ] Include all necessary Firebase service configurations
- [ ] Configuration file is properly structured and documented

### AC 1.5: Offline persistence enabled for Firestore operations
- [ ] Configure Firestore offline persistence in SDK initialization
- [ ] Enable offline data caching for restaurant data
- [ ] Enable offline data caching for review data
- [ ] Configure automatic sync when connection is restored

## Technical Implementation Details

### Firebase Project Setup
1. **Project Creation**: Create new Firebase project named "esplanada-eats"
2. **Database Configuration**: Enable Firestore in test mode with location us-central1
3. **Storage Setup**: Enable Cloud Storage with default bucket naming

### Security Rules Implementation
```javascript
// Firestore Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /restaurants/{restaurant} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Test mode - will be restricted later
    }
    match /reviews/{review} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Test mode - will be restricted later
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration File Structure
```javascript
// firebase-config.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

## Dependencies
- Firebase Console access
- Google account with Firebase project creation permissions
- Web browser for Firebase Console operations

## Success Metrics
- Firebase project successfully created and accessible
- Firestore database operational and responding to queries
- Storage bucket ready for file uploads
- Security rules properly configured and active
- Configuration file ready for SDK integration

## Notes
- Initial setup uses test mode security rules for development
- Production security rules will be enhanced in subsequent stories
- All Firebase services must be in the same geographic region for optimal performance
