# Story 0.1: Firebase Project Configuration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure Firebase project with Firestore and Storage,
**so that** I have a cloud backend for data persistence and file storage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Firebase project created with Firestore database enabled
2. Firebase Storage bucket configured for image uploads
3. Firebase Security Rules established for restaurants and reviews collections
4. Firebase project configuration file (firebase-config.js) created
5. Offline persistence enabled for Firestore operations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create Firebase project and enable services (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create Firebase project in Firebase Console
  - [ ] Enable Firestore database in test mode
  - [ ] Configure database location (us-central1)
  - [ ] Enable Firebase Storage for project
  - [ ] Create storage bucket for restaurant photos
  - [ ] Configure storage bucket location to match Firestore region
  - [ ] Verify Firestore and Storage are accessible and operational
- [ ] Task 2: Configure Firebase Security Rules (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create Firestore security rules for restaurants collection
  - [ ] Create Firestore security rules for reviews collection
  - [ ] Create Firebase Storage security rules for image uploads
  - [ ] Configure rules to allow read/write access with validation
  - [ ] Verify rules prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Task 3: Create Firebase configuration file (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Generate Firebase project configuration from Firebase Console
  - [ ] Create firebase-config.js file with project credentials
  - [ ] Include all necessary Firebase service configurations
  - [ ] Add proper documentation to configuration file
- [ ] Task 4: Enable offline persistence (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Configure Firestore offline persistence in SDK initialization
  - [ ] Enable offline data caching for restaurant data
  - [ ] Enable offline data caching for review data
  - [ ] Configure automatic sync when connection is restored

## Dev Notes
This story establishes the foundational Firebase cloud infrastructure that will replace the localStorage-based system with a real-time, collaborative platform.

### Technical Implementation Details
**Firebase Project Setup:**
- Project name: "esplanada-eats"
- Database: Firestore in test mode
- Location: us-central1
- Storage: Cloud Storage with default bucket naming

**Security Rules Implementation:**
```javascript
// Firestore Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /restaurants/{restaurant} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Test mode - will be restricted later
    }
    match /reviews/{review} {
      allow read, write: if true; // Test mode - will be restricted later
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration File Structure:**
```javascript
// firebase-config.js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Testing
No specific testing requirements found in architecture docs for this infrastructure setup story.
