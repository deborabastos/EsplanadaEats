# Esplanada Eats Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview and Introduction

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Deliver a fully functional single-page web application for restaurant discovery and rating
- Enable collaborative restaurant registration without complex authentication
- Provide users with comprehensive restaurant information including quality, price, access, and dietary options
- Create a reliable rating system with duplicate prevention
- Ensure mobile-responsive design that works across all devices
- Implement cloud-based storage solution using Firebase for real-time data sharing
- Provide immediate value with collaborative features and community-driven insights

#### Background Context
The Esplanada Eats project addresses the common problem of discovering and evaluating restaurants in a specific region. Current solutions often require complex registration, have centralized control, or lack community-driven insights. This project creates a collaborative platform where anyone can contribute restaurant information and ratings. The solution uses Firebase Firestore for cloud-based storage, enabling real-time data sharing across all users while maintaining accessibility and ease of deployment.
