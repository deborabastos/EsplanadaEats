## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Create a comprehensive UX/UI design system for Esplanada Eats focusing on mobile-first responsive design, intuitive card-based restaurant discovery interface, and accessible modal interactions. Design should emphasize visual clarity, ease of contribution, and food-appropriate aesthetics. Consider user flows for discovery, registration, and rating scenarios.

### Architect Prompt
Design the technical architecture for Esplanada Eats as a client-side single-page application using localStorage for data persistence. Implement modular JavaScript architecture with separation of concerns between data management, UI control, validation, and utilities. Ensure proper error handling, performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility within the constraints of localStorage (~5MB limit).
