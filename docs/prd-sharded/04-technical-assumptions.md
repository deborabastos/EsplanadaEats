# Esplanada Eats Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
The project shall be organized as a single repository with clear separation of concerns between HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality. All files shall be contained within a single directory structure for easy deployment to static hosting platforms.

### Service Architecture
**CRITICAL DECISION** - Document the high-level service architecture (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless functions within a Monorepo).

The application shall be implemented as a client-side monolith with no backend services. All business logic, data persistence, and user interface shall be contained within a single-page application running entirely in the browser. Architecture shall follow modular JavaScript patterns with separation between data management, UI control, validation, and utility functions.

### Testing Requirements
**CRITICAL DECISION** - Document the testing requirements, unit only, integration, e2e, manual, need for manual testing convenience methods.

Testing shall focus on manual verification due to the client-side nature of the application. No automated testing framework shall be implemented in the MVP. Testing shall include manual verification of all user flows, browser compatibility testing, and mobile responsiveness validation. A manual testing checklist shall be maintained covering all core functionality.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- The application shall use ES6+ JavaScript features with progressive enhancement for older browsers
- CSS shall be implemented using native CSS3 with custom properties for theming
- No build process or transpilation shall be required for development
- Image optimization shall be handled client-side using Canvas API
- Browser fingerprinting shall use basic browser characteristics (userAgent, screen resolution, timezone)
- Data serialization shall use JSON format with error handling for corrupted data
- The application shall implement graceful degradation for localStorage quota exceeded scenarios
