## Epic 3 User Rating & Review System

**Epic Goal:** Create comprehensive user rating system with duplicate prevention, user identification, and dynamic average calculations. This epic delivers the core community functionality that makes the platform valuable.

### Story 3.1 User Identification System
As a user, I want to be identified uniquely when rating restaurants, so that my contributions are properly attributed and duplicate ratings are prevented.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.1: Browser fingerprinting system using browser characteristics
1.2: User name input combined with fingerprint for identification
1.3: Duplicate tracking system preventing multiple ratings per user per restaurant
1.4: Graceful handling when fingerprinting is not available
1.5: User identification persists across browser sessions using localStorage

### Story 3.2 Rating Form & Interface
As a user, I want to rate restaurants with an intuitive interface, so that I can easily share my experience with others.

2.2: All rating criteria (quality, price, access, vegetarian options)
2.3: Optional comment and photo upload fields
2.4: Clear form validation and submission feedback
2.5: Rating modal accessible from both restaurant cards and detail modal

### Story 3.3 Duplicate Prevention Logic
As a system, I want to prevent multiple ratings from the same user, so that rating integrity is maintained and gaming the system is difficult.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
3.1: Check for existing ratings before allowing new submission
3.2: Clear messaging when user has already rated a restaurant
3.3: Prevention logic works across browser sessions
3.4: Fallback mechanisms when fingerprinting fails

**Acceptance Criteria:**

4.2: Dynamic updates when new ratings are submitted
4.3: Display of individual user ratings in restaurant detail modal
4.4: Proper handling of edge cases (single rating, zero ratings)
4.5: Rating persistence across browser sessions

### Story 3.5 Rating Photos & Comments
As a user, I want to add photos and comments to my ratings, so that I can provide more detailed feedback about my experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
5.1: Optional photo upload with same validation as restaurant photos
5.2: Comment field with XSS prevention sanitization
5.3: Display of user photos and comments in restaurant detail modal
