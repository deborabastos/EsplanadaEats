# Esplanada Eats Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Restaurant Discovery System**
The application shall display restaurants in a responsive card-based layout showing name, average quality rating, and price range information. Cards shall be organized in a responsive grid (4 cards per row on desktop, 1 card per row on mobile) with ordering defaulting to highest-rated restaurants first.

**FR2: Restaurant Detail Modal**
Clicking on a restaurant card shall open a modal displaying comprehensive information including operating hours, current open/closed status, detailed description, address, photo gallery, and individual user reviews with ratings. The modal shall open as an overlay on the homepage and be closable via X button, clicking outside, or ESC key.

**FR3: Restaurant Registration System**
The application shall provide a registration form allowing users to add new restaurants with mandatory fields (name, operating hours, price range, initial quality assessment, vegetarian options, access level) and optional fields (description, photos). The form shall open in a modal triggered by a button in the top-right corner of the homepage.

**FR4: User Rating System**
Users shall be able to rate restaurants using a modal form with mandatory fields (user name, quality rating 0-5 stars, price rating 0-5 stars, access level, vegetarian options) and optional fields (comments, photos). Ratings shall use 0.5-point increments for quality and price assessment.

**FR5: Duplicate Prevention System**
The application shall prevent multiple ratings from the same user for the same restaurant using browser fingerprinting and localStorage combination. The system shall identify users based on browser characteristics and maintain duplicate prevention records as long as identification is possible.

**FR6: Dynamic Rating Calculation**
The application shall automatically calculate and display average ratings for each restaurant based on all user submissions. Calculations shall use simple averaging and update dynamically when new ratings are submitted.

**FR7: Image Management System**
The application shall support image upload for both restaurant registration (up to 4 photos) and user ratings (optional photos). Images shall be automatically optimized for web display with format validation (JPG, PNG, WebP) and size restrictions (2MB maximum).

**FR8: User Identification System**
The application shall implement a user identification system combining name input with browser fingerprinting to uniquely identify users without requiring authentication. This system shall be used for both rating attribution and duplicate prevention.

**FR9: Empty State Handling**
The application shall display appropriate messaging when no restaurants are available ("Sem restaurantes cadastrados") and hide card containers in such states.

**FR10: Form Validation System**
All forms shall implement real-time validation with visual feedback (red highlighting) and clear error messages for mandatory field requirements and input format validation.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Cloud-Based Architecture**
The application shall be implemented as a single-page application using vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) with Firebase SDK integration. All data persistence shall use Firebase Firestore with Firebase Storage for image uploads, enabling real-time data sharing across all users.

**NFR2: Mobile-First Responsive Design**
The application shall be designed using mobile-first principles with responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. All core functionality shall be accessible on mobile devices.

**NFR3: Performance Requirements**
All application operations shall complete within 2 seconds. Image uploads shall be processed with Firebase Storage optimization. Firebase operations shall use efficient queries and real-time listeners for optimal performance.

**NFR4: Security Requirements**
The application shall implement client-side input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks. All user inputs shall be validated and sanitized before display. Image uploads shall be validated for file type and size restrictions.

**NFR5: Browser Compatibility**
The application shall support modern browsers including Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, and Edge 80+. Progressive enhancement shall be applied for broader compatibility.

**NFR6: Data Persistence**
The application shall provide persistent data storage using Firebase Firestore with automatic backup and synchronization. All user-contributed data shall be preserved and accessible across sessions and devices.

**NFR7: Offline Functionality**
The application shall implement Firebase offline persistence, allowing basic functionality when network connectivity is lost. Data shall automatically sync when connection is restored.

**NFR8: Accessibility Standards**
The application shall implement basic accessibility features including semantic HTML, ARIA labels for interactive elements, keyboard navigation support, and sufficient color contrast ratios.
