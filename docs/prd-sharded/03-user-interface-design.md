# Esplanada Eats Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, intuitive restaurant discovery experience that emphasizes visual clarity and ease of contribution. The interface shall guide users naturally from discovery to contribution with minimal friction. Visual design shall use food-friendly colors and restaurant-appropriate iconography to create an appetizing, trustworthy atmosphere.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Card-based Discovery**: Users browse restaurants through visually appealing cards that provide essential information at a glance
- **Modal Interactions**: All detailed interactions (viewing, adding, rating) occur in non-disruptive modals
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced experience for modern browsers
- **Immediate Feedback**: All user actions receive immediate visual feedback to confirm successful operations

### Core Screens and Views
- **Homepage/Discovery Screen**: Primary interface showing restaurant cards in responsive grid layout
- **Restaurant Detail Modal**: Comprehensive restaurant information including photos, hours, and reviews
- **Add Restaurant Modal**: Form for registering new restaurants with validation and preview
- **Rate Restaurant Modal**: Rating interface with star-based input system and photo upload
- **Empty State Screen**: Messaging and call-to-action when no restaurants are available

### Accessibility: Basic Implementation
The application shall implement WCAG AA Level A compliance including semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast compliance.

### Branding
Clean, modern design with food-friendly color palette using green (representing fresh/healthy), warm accent colors for restaurant types, and professional typography. Iconography shall use intuitive food and restaurant symbols.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application shall be fully responsive across all device sizes with mobile-first design approach. Core functionality shall work identically across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.
