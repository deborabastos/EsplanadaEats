## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Restaurant Discovery System**
The application shall display restaurants in a responsive card-based layout showing name, average quality rating, and price range information. Cards shall be organized in a responsive grid (4 cards per row on desktop, 1 card per row on mobile) with ordering defaulting to highest-rated restaurants first.

**FR2: Restaurant Detail Modal**
Clicking on a restaurant card shall open a modal displaying comprehensive information including operating hours, current open/closed status, detailed description, address, photo gallery, and individual user reviews with ratings. The modal shall open as an overlay on the homepage and be closable via X button, clicking outside, or ESC key.

**FR3: Restaurant Registration System**
The application shall provide a registration form allowing users to add new restaurants with mandatory fields (name, operating hours, price range, initial quality assessment, vegetarian options, access level) and optional fields (description, photos). The form shall open in a modal triggered by a button in the top-right corner of the homepage.

**FR4: User Rating System**
Users shall be able to rate restaurants using a modal form with mandatory fields (user name, quality rating 0-5 stars, price rating 0-5 stars, access level, vegetarian options) and optional fields (comments, photos). Ratings shall use 0.5-point increments for quality and price assessment.

**FR5: Duplicate Prevention System**
The application shall prevent multiple ratings from the same user for the same restaurant using browser fingerprinting and localStorage combination. The system shall identify users based on browser characteristics and maintain duplicate prevention records as long as identification is possible.

**FR6: Dynamic Rating Calculation**
The application shall automatically calculate and display average ratings for each restaurant based on all user submissions. Calculations shall use simple averaging and update dynamically when new ratings are submitted.

**FR7: Image Management System**
The application shall support image upload for both restaurant registration (up to 4 photos) and user ratings (optional photos). Images shall be automatically optimized for web display with format validation (JPG, PNG, WebP) and size restrictions (2MB maximum).

**FR8: User Identification System**
The application shall implement a user identification system combining name input with browser fingerprinting to uniquely identify users without requiring authentication. This system shall be used for both rating attribution and duplicate prevention.

**FR9: Empty State Handling**
The application shall display appropriate messaging when no restaurants are available ("Sem restaurantes cadastrados") and hide card containers in such states.

**FR10: Form Validation System**
All forms shall implement real-time validation with visual feedback (red highlighting) and clear error messages for mandatory field requirements and input format validation.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Cloud-Based Architecture**
The application shall be implemented as a single-page application using vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) with Firebase SDK integration. All data persistence shall use Firebase Firestore with Firebase Storage for image uploads, enabling real-time data sharing across all users.

The application shall implement basic accessibility features including semantic HTML, ARIA labels for interactive elements, keyboard navigation support, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, intuitive restaurant discovery experience that emphasizes visual clarity and ease of contribution. The interface shall guide users naturally from discovery to contribution with minimal friction. Visual design shall use food-friendly colors and restaurant-appropriate iconography to create an appetizing, trustworthy atmosphere.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Card-based Discovery**: Users browse restaurants through visually appealing cards that provide essential information at a glance
- **Modal Interactions**: All detailed interactions (viewing, adding, rating) occur in non-disruptive modals
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced experience for modern browsers
- **Immediate Feedback**: All user actions receive immediate visual feedback to confirm successful operations

### Core Screens and Views
- **Homepage/Discovery Screen**: Primary interface showing restaurant cards in responsive grid layout
- **Restaurant Detail Modal**: Comprehensive restaurant information including photos, hours, and reviews
- **Add Restaurant Modal**: Form for registering new restaurants with validation and preview
- **Rate Restaurant Modal**: Rating interface with star-based input system and photo upload
- **Empty State Screen**: Messaging and call-to-action when no restaurants are available

### Accessibility: Basic Implementation
The application shall implement WCAG AA Level A compliance including semantic HTML structure, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast compliance.

### Branding
Clean, modern design with food-friendly color palette using green (representing fresh/healthy), warm accent colors for restaurant types, and professional typography. Iconography shall use intuitive food and restaurant symbols.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application shall be fully responsive across all device sizes with mobile-first design approach. Core functionality shall work identically across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
The project shall be organized as a single repository with clear separation of concerns between HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality. All files shall be contained within a single directory structure for easy deployment to static hosting platforms.

### Service Architecture
**CRITICAL DECISION** - Document the high-level service architecture (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless functions within a Monorepo).

The application shall be implemented as a client-side monolith with no backend services. All business logic, data persistence, and user interface shall be contained within a single-page application running entirely in the browser. Architecture shall follow modular JavaScript patterns with separation between data management, UI control, validation, and utility functions.

### Testing Requirements
**CRITICAL DECISION** - Document the testing requirements, unit only, integration, e2e, manual, need for manual testing convenience methods.

Testing shall focus on manual verification due to the client-side nature of the application. No automated testing framework shall be implemented in the MVP. Testing shall include manual verification of all user flows, browser compatibility testing, and mobile responsiveness validation. A manual testing checklist shall be maintained covering all core functionality.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- The application shall use ES6+ JavaScript features with progressive enhancement for older browsers
- CSS shall be implemented using native CSS3 with custom properties for theming
- No build process or transpilation shall be required for development
- Image optimization shall be handled client-side using Canvas API
- Browser fingerprinting shall use basic browser characteristics (userAgent, screen resolution, timezone)
- Data serialization shall use JSON format with error handling for corrupted data
- The application shall implement graceful degradation for localStorage quota exceeded scenarios
